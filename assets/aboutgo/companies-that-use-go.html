                As Go adapts and more packages are introduced that expand its ability to excell above other
                common programming languages, companies will no doubt pick it up over the more common
                alternatives. Currently, Go has had a boom in use cases for back-end systems from companies
                of all sizes. Primarily due to Go's ability to run fact and effienctly on hardware compared
                to other languags.

                They originally used Python for many of their datastore schemaless sharding layers. 
                As the company grew, their infrastructure did as well and Python fell short of 
                speed requirements. They replaced these systems to Go to reduce stress on hardware 
                and decrease overall latency.

                Used as part of many of Google’s services Go is no stranger to them. From Chrome, 
                Android, Google Earth, services for large downloads through Google, and YouTube the 
                company has utilized their created language heavily for many of their systems.

                A company very much like youtube, they use Go to to handle automation of API’s and testing. 
                In addition, much of their back end systems utilize Go as their language of choice for the 
                increase speed and simplicity.

                A company largely known for video gaming streaming and content, they use Go (along with 
                some C++) to transcode video streams from RTMP to HLS. In addition they use Go as part of 
                their system to deliver high quality streaming to their users.

                Focusing on cloud storage, they use Go to replace many of their back end systems previously 
                written in Python. The change was to increase their internal processing speed and efficiency 
                for their scalable systems.

                for many large corporations such as Uber, Airbnb, and Spotify. Much of their API was written 
                using Go to keep their systems quick and scalable.
