            <h3>Goroutines</h3>
            <p>In Go, writing functions that can run in parallel is as easy as 
               writing functions that run in a sequence. This makes taking full
               advantage of a modern computer's processing power even easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike Java, goroutines have growables segmented stacks which exponentially 
                increase the number of goroutines a processor can handle at any one time. Also,
                instead of using OS threads, goroutines are created within the user level.
                This trick allows for many goroutines to exist as if they are running on multiple 
                cores that the RTE scheduler handles CPU time allocation. The result of this difference 
                allows there to be exponentially more goroutines at any given time.
            </p>
            <p>
                When two goroutines need to communicate and share data, where this would be a perfect
                setup for race conditions with traditional thread programming, they do so through
                channels. These channels act as a pipeline of comunication but also handle
                synchronizing that data automatically, greatly removing the possibility of race
                conditions. The idea behind this was rather than have threads which <i>communicate
                by sharing memory</i> they <i>share memory by communicating.</i> 
            </p>
            <p>
                Goroutines strive to be as simple as possible, yet retain a quick processing speed
                and minimal system impact. They achieve this by making its features require little
                direction, such as not defining mutexes when sharing data through channels and
                allowing the routines to dynamically increase their stack sizes as they determine
                they need more space.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating a goroutine</h3>
            <p>
                Creating goroutines are <b>extremely</b> simple. All you need to do is invoke the
                <code>'go'</code> keyword on a function. For example, with <code>go methodName()</code>
                we are telling Go to create a goroutine for the methodName function that will be its
                own process in a thread. At this point we have a goroutine running in parallel to the 
                process that created it.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the goroutine is finished processing its code, simply letting the function 
                fall through will remove the goroutine and the garbage collector will free up the used 
                memory.
            </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p> Channels are the backbone of the goroutine's funcationality. They work as a pipleline for
                data from one goroutine to another but handle the race conditions internally which
                substantionally reduces overhead by the developer without reducing effiency of the program.
            </p>
            <p>
                When creating a channel, you must create a variable for that channel, which functions as
                a pointer to that channel's location in memory, then invoke the keyword <code>make</code>
                with parameters <code>chan</code> indicating that you wish to make a channel and the type
                for that channel which controls the type of data that channel can send. In addition,
                you can also add a buffer size to the channel controlling the amount of data that channel
                can contain at any one time. By default, these channels can only contain a single item of 
                its type. At face value this might not seem to be an issue but in practice most channels 
                will be used to send multiple instances of that data type through the channel. This 
                is the inherity bonus from buffering a channel. If you know that said channel will be 
                expecting multiple values being sent at once, the buffer will tell the run time environment 
                to make enough memory to support that, similar to an array or slice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Muck like the switch statement, channels can use a similar type of control flow called
                <code>select</code>. The select statment is utilized heavely when more than one channel
                controls how a goroutine proceeds. The <code>select</code> statment handles the channels 
                by choosing the how to proceed based on which channel gets information received first.
                If channel 'a' get information received before channel 'b' then channel 'a' will be accepted
                and the goroutine will proceed however it was designed to handle that situation. Although
                the <code>select</code> statement handles many of the issues with multichannel funcatonality,
                there is still some randomness. If both channels send receive data simultaneously then the 
                <code>select</code> will choose at random which one to proceed with. A potential
                problem if left unconsidered in design.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating a channel</h3>
            <p>
                Unbuffered channel: <code>messages := make(chan string)</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Buffered channel: <code>messages := make(chan string, 3)</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                When finished with a channel, simply close the channel with the <code>close()</code> method
                passing in the channel variable you wish to close. Example: <code>close(messages)</code>
            </p>
