            <h3>History of Go</h3>
            <p>
                Golang, or Go as it is more commonly referred to, was created by Robert Griesemer, 
                Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 while they worked at Google. Their goal with the 
                language was to solve issues within Google with other languages at the time such
                as "slowness and clumsiness" of software development. By doing so they kept the 
                idea that Go would be a programming language written by programmers for 
                programmers. In essence, the language was what they claim to be the best elements
                of C, Pascal, and Oberon. As a result of their efforts, their concepts and design
                was praised by companies for the safety and performance that Go offered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after Go's founding, they decided that it would 
                be of benefit to make the language open to the public to both help with 
                development through open source and increase public exposure of Go. Since the 2009 
                debut, there have been many modifications to the syntax and sematics of the 
                language. These changes were the result of Google's attempts at removing elements 
                of C that they thought by doing so would make the structure of Go programs even 
                easier to use and design with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Go has became a real contender against the plethora of available languages 
                and as time progresses more companies are starting to pick it up. For instance, 
                in 2014 Dropbox adopted Go over its current Python infrastructure for the 
                performance increase it brings to their critical back end systems which was a 
                large step for Go as a whole. Since then, other companis have chosen to implement 
                some elements of their software using Go with this number growing each year.
            </p>
            <h3>Why use Go?</h3>
            <p>
                There are many benefits as to why one would like to use Go over other projects. 
                Although some specifics are coveed elsewhere on this site, such as goroutines, 
                there are some basic improvements that Go offers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Go is fast and efficient!</b>
                With many of the benefits of speed from C and C++, Go is the best of both worlds. 
                The development pocess has been made easy as the syntax is extemely similar to 
                already popular C allowing for more people to have a good initial understanding 
                of the language but with alot of the complexity from C simplified.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Go has garbage collection!</b>
                A highly attractive feature for Go is its implementation of a garbage collector. 
                Seen as a downtrade for C and C++, the garbage collection sight for sore eyes for 
                developers that have became accustomed to this feature. As an added bonus, the 
                garbage collector is implemented to run concurrently along side the program. And 
                with further features to limit how garbage collection is scheduled, it can keep 
                programs with Go at a very low latency.
            </p>
            <p><code>Go garbage collection timing(map based): ~8ms</code></p>
            <p><code>Java garbage collection timing(map based): ~153ms</code></p>
            <p>
                <b>Go has concurrency!</b>
                Easily one of the main attractors of Go is it's rich support for concurrency. 
                Through goroutines you are able to create multiple "green threads", threads that 
                are controlled by the Go RTE rather than the operating system, like in JAVA. This 
                gives the benefit of assigning multiple goroutines to a single OS thread 
                exponentially increasing the total number that can be run at any given time. 
                Additionally, through channels goroutines can easily handle shared data without
                the dangers of getting stuck and locking up.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Go has large company backings!</b>
                A large boost to Go is its corporate backings already in its lifetime. There are 
                already some major companies, not just including Google, that are utilizing go as 
                part of their development process. With these big names picking it up, that might 
                entice future adopters and developments for the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Go is open source!</b>
                When done correctly, open source development can be a wonderful thing for the 
                product. Some of the benefits include reduction in cost of development, increased 
                reliability due to more contributions that everyone can view, transparency of the 
                product which is refreshing in this time for many users/developers, typically 
                better security as more people from many backgrounds contribute their experiences 
                in their code, and lastly a solid community of people all working to make Go 
                better for everyone.
            </p>

            <h3>Cons of Go</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Go does not have generic types</b>
                Something that some developers might claim as a step in the wrong direction with 
                object oriented programming, Go does not have any type of generics like we are 
                used to in Java. This can be toublesome when trying to develop algorithms that work 
                with numerious different data types or creating objects that can represent different 
                things yet still use the same methods and such. But despite this, there is a light at the 
                end of a tunnel. Contributors of Go are currently working on a rough system for how Go 
                might handle generics. This addition is slated for a future release once it has gotten 
                the check and final appoval. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Go's error handling</b>
                Some point of contention with Go is how it handles, or more better put how it <i>doesn't</i> 
                handle errors. In Java errors are handled through try/catch blocks where the catch 
                section is executed in the event of an exception or error being thrown. Go treats 
                errors as return values from functions and can range from improper arguments passed 
                into the function to something going wrong within it. Using this format <code>retVal, err 
                := function(args); </code> the error will be passed into <code>err</code> which then 
                can be checked in an if/else statement. <code>err</code> is nil when the function 
                did not throw an error.
