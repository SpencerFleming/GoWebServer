            <h3>Arrays</h3>
            <p>Arrays in Go should seem fairly familar as they are similar to Java.</p>
            <p>
                Array definitions specify length and element type.
                An array’s size is fixed so each element type and
                length combination is its own data type.
                <code>[4]int</code>
                and
                <code>[5]int</code>
                are incompatible distinct types.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Go a variable that represents an array contains the entire array opposed to the variable containing a pointer to
                the first value. As such,
                arrays are passed by value (a copy of the array). One can think of an array as a struct with indexed
                fields.
            </p>
            <h3>What are Slices</h3>
            <p>
                Slices are “dynamic windows” into static arrays. A Slice represents a flexible-length array-like data
                type that is a window into an array. One could view a slice as a struct with a pointer to the array
                element where the slice starts. This means slice manipulations are inexpensive as you are basically just
                changing pointer values. Warning: two overlapping slices point to the same place in memory so any change
                to the array via a slice will be reflected in both slices. The good news is that go provides a
                collection of built in slice functions to avoid common problems like this. The <code>copy()</code>
                mechanism is one
                that will address this issue.
            </p>
            <h3>Creating a slice</h3>
            <p>
                Slice literals are declared just like array literals without the size.
                <code>Slice :=[]String{“a”,”b”,”c”}</code> or you can use the make function,
                <code>s = make([]byte, 5, 5)</code>. You can also make a
                slice by slicing an existing array. You can also create a slice from an existing array
            </p>
